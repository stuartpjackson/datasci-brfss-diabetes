# datasci-brfss-diabetes
Example R code for analyzing the annual BRFSS survey.

### About
The example R code was used to extract survey data related to health and lifestyle factors, and to develop models for predicting diabetes diagnosis from survey responses. The code was applied across 3 year's worth of survey data (responses from ~1.5million respondents in total). 

The relevant R files are (in order):
- load_transform_brfss.R
- figure1_exploratory_analysis.R
- figure2_model_fitting.R
- figure3_cluster_analysis.R

Note that the raw data files are not included in this remote archive (due to size constraints); these can be downloaded from the BRFSS website linked below. The preprocessed data, as well as analysis outputs and figures, are included here. To reuse this code, modify the paths to relevant local data folders as appropriate.
